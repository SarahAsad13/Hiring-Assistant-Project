2. **Backend:** A FastAPI-based backend that handles file uploads, processes resumes to extract entities, and interacts with the Neo4j database.

3. **Database:** A Neo4j graph database to store and manage extracted entities and their relationships.

**Technologies Used:** Python, FastAPI for backend development, React for frontend development, Named Entity Recognition (NER) - Natural Language Processing (NLP) Library for Entity Recognition and Docker for deployment.
